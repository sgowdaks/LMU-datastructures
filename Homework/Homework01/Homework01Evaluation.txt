you got 22 out of 25 which is 88% which is a B-plus

Several problems here:

   1. Everything compiled fine from the command line, but since you have the
      two "package" statements, it wouldn't run.  When you include those the
      JVM is looking in the package to find the "main()" method, and since
      there's no package on MY machine, I get an error that the JVM can't
      find or load the main class HighArrayApp.  I have a feeling this is
      because you are using an IDE, which I have mentioned in class several
      times.  MAKE SURE YOUR CODE WILL COMPILE AND RUN DIRECTLY FROM THE
      COMMAND LINE/TERMINAL WINDOW BEFORE YOU COMMIT.  Next time you'll get
      no credit for otherwise working code.
   2. Your output, while correct, is very hard to read, because there aren't
      any line breaks.  It will help for readability for each output to go
      on a separate line.  I notice that in your "display()" method you are
      using "System.out.print()" and you have commented out the line after
      it which uses "System.out.println()".  The "ln" at the end of the name
      of the "System.out.println()" method makes sure that there is a newline
      output.
   3. Finally, the specification calls for at least 5 tests for the "getMax()"
      method.  You only have one test.  You could have made up two of your
      lost points if you had put file headers in your code ~ those were extra
      credit points.

Still, not a bad first effort!  Hang in there and keep up the good work!
