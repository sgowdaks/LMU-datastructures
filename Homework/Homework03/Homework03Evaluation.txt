===============================================
Nice work on this assignment!  Just a couple of comments/observations:

I may have mentioned previously that convention says you should name a class
file starting with an uppercase letter.  Your 'oddEvenSort' program should
be named as 'OddEvenSort' or better yet, 'OddEvenSorter' which is the noun
version of what it does.  At least you got the name of the class and file to
match!  Also, while it does work, the more information you give to the user,
the more your program will be appreciated.  You do say that the output is a
"sorted array" but that doesn't mean a lot without either seeing the array
BEFORE it is sorted, or having to look at the code.  Still, it works!

Huffman works fine, once I commented out your package statements.  You guys
need to knock it off with that.  You don't need to do a package if all the
code is in the same directory.  You especially cause problems if you name a
package differently than the directory it is in.  If packages is a thing you
need to do to get the program to work with your IDE like VSCode or something,
I get that, but PLEASE, as I have said many times before, MAKE SURE YOUR CODE
RUNS FROM THE COMMAND LINE, since that's how I evaluate it.  It is only
costing you 1/2 point this time, but next time, no credit for problem with a
package statement unless the problem specification asks for it.

Nice job on Simon!  You are really using some good sophisticated Java code
in this one.  Good idea to limit the user to three games, otherwise they may
get bored...
