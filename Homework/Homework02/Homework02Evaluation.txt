Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Overall, a pretty good job on this assignment!  You did what was required,
and it all works as advertised.

A couple of things to keep in mind when you're writing software in general:
   1. Your QueueApp class could use a little more output to the user, to let
      her know what is going on with the program.  For example, you never
      print out the original contents of the first Queue with 10, 20, ... 60
      so that the user knows it exists and works.  You never test the two
      methods "isFull()" and "isEmpty()", although that wasn't really one of
      the requirements.  You also didn't test your "peekFront()".  It's a
      good idea to test EVERYTHING.
   2. Same things go for the Deque and DequeApp program ~ you don't test
      either "removeXXX()" method, nor do you check the "isFull()" and
      "isEmpty()" methods.  Those WERE required tests.
   3. The more information you print to the display to let the user know the
      state of the system, the better the user will like your software.  I do
      appreciate that you wrote comments in your code to tell me what I will
      expect, but it's better to output that to the user.  Try to go for an
      "expected" vs. "actual" approach, such as
            expected:   [40][50][60][70]
            actual:     [40][50][60][70]
   4. In your CircularStack program, you should display the list values as a
      STACK rather than just a LIST.  There are several ways to do this....

Other than that, nice job, and your code is very nice looking!

You got 31 out of 35 which is 88.57% which is a B-plus

======================================
Homework total for the semester

      homework01  88.00% of 5 points =  4.40 points
      homework02  88.57% of 5 points =  4.43 points
                          Total points: 8.83 points = 88.29%
                                                       which is a B-plus

Keep up the good work ~ you've got this.......
